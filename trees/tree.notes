Tree is a non linear data structure.
It is used when we have to represent data in a hierarchial
form.

Tree has the following three main traversals
1) Inorder -> 	Left->Root->Right  (everything done in order)
2) Preorder ->  Root->Left->Right  (Root at first then the rest)
3) PostOrder -> Left->Right->Root  (Root at end and remaining in order)
